# Application configuration
# ———
# Project identifier used for Docker Compose project name, networks, and logs.
# Allowed characters: lowercase letters, digits, underscore (_), and hyphen (-).
CHARCOAL_PROJECT=foundation-app
# Comma-separated list of services to build/run (e.g., engine,web,mysql,redis).
# If dev/sapi.manifest.json is present, it takes precedence for enabling
# interfaces, port mappings, and docroots.
CHARCOAL_DOCKER=engine,web,mysql,redis
# Base application class resolved under the "App\Domain\" namespace and used by
# the kernel during bootstrap.
CHARCOAL_APP=CharcoalApp

# Network configuration
# ———
# Private subnet for internal container-to-container traffic only.
# Usable host range for this example: .2–.30
CHARCOAL_CIDR_PRIVATE=10.0.11.0/27
# Edge (public/host-reachable) subnet. Use for endpoints you want accessible
# from the host or trusted networks. Usable host range: .34–.62
CHARCOAL_CIDR_EDGE=10.0.11.32/27

# Internal static IP assignments (private subnet)
# ———
# These addresses are only reachable within the private network and allow
# containers to communicate predictably.
# SAPIs provided by the framework:
SAPI_ENGINE_IP=10.0.11.2
SAPI_WEB_IP=10.0.11.11
# Auxiliary services (if included):
SERVICE_MYSQL_IP=10.0.11.27
SERVICE_REDIS_IP=10.0.11.28
SERVICE_PMA_IP=10.0.11.29

# Edge/exposed addresses (edge subnet)
# ———
# These are reachable from the host or other trusted networks.
# For the web SAPI, Nginx listens on port 6000 internally by default.
EDGE_WEB_IP=10.0.11.50
# Edge IP for phpMyAdmin, if you want it reachable outside the private network.
EDGE_PMA_IP=10.0.11.60

# MySQL credentials
# If "mysql" is included in CHARCOAL_DOCKER, a MySQL instance will be created.
# MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD initializes the MySQL root account and is required for
# initial database creation and administrative tasks.
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=changeme
# Application database user password (for the provisioned "charcoal" user).
# Keep this in sync with your application’s database configuration.
MYSQL_PASSWORD=changeme

# phpMyAdmin — host binding and port publishing
# ———
# Host interface/IP to bind the phpMyAdmin port to.
# Default 127.0.0.1 (loopback) restricts access to the local machine only — not reachable from other hosts.
# To allow access from your network or the internet, set this to your host's public IP (e.g., 192.168.1.10)
# or 0.0.0.0 to bind on all interfaces (only if you understand the exposure and have proper firewall rules).
EDGE_PMA_BIND=127.0.0.1
# Host TCP port that forwards to phpMyAdmin's container port 80.
# - Choose an unused port on the host.
# - Effective exposure is a combination of EDGE_PMA_BIND + EDGE_PMA_PORT.
#   Example (LAN access): EDGE_PMA_BIND=192.168.1.10 and EDGE_PMA_PORT=10786
EDGE_PMA_PORT=10786
